# coupled-radio-interferometer
A repo for deomstrating the semi-analytic, first-order, antenna-antenna coupling formalism presented in 'Array Element Coupling in Radio Interferometry I: A Semi-Analytic Approach'

To get the ipython notebook to run, you will need to clone the following, public, Github repos:       

https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_pspec

https://github.com/HERA-Team/hera_cal/

https://github.com/HERA-Team/uvtools (you must checkout the branch 'plot_range_control')

https://github.com/rasg-affiliates/healvis (you must checkout the branch 'setup_all_bls_and_peak_norm_beam')



Afterward, you will need to pip (or conda) install the following modules:
