Coupled Radio Interferometer
===========

For using the semi-analytic, first-order, antenna-antenna coupling formalism presented in [Array Element Coupling in Radio Interferometry I: A Semi-Analytic Approach](http://XXX) 

## Installation

Preferred method of installation for users is simply `pip install .`
(or `pip install git+https://github.com/alphatangojuliett/CoupledRadioInterferometer`). This should install 
required dependencies.

## Tutorials

We include two Jupyter notebooks: First and most importantly, [`tutorials/first_order_coupling_demo.ipynb`](tutorials/first_order_coupling_demo.ipynb), a demostration of the coupling formalism. Second, [`tutorials/airy_Efield_Beam_for_demo`](tutorials/airy_Efield_Beam_for_demo.ipynb), a brief 
tutorial for how the beam object used in the demo was constructed.
