Coupled Radio Interferometer
===========

For using the semi-analytic, first-order, antenna-antenna coupling formalism presented in ["Array Element Coupling in Radio Interferometry I: A Semi-Analytic Approach"](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac916).

## Installation

Preferred method of installation for users is simply `pip install .`, after cloning to repo. This should also install all 
required dependencies. NOTE: Before installation, ensure that git-lfs is installed on your local machine.

## Tutorials

We include two Jupyter notebooks: First and most importantly, [`tutorials/first_order_coupling_demo.ipynb`](tutorials/first_order_coupling_demo.ipynb), a demostration of the coupling formalism. Second, [`tutorials/airy_Efield_Beam_for_demo`](tutorials/airy_Efield_Beam_for_demo.ipynb), a brief 
tutorial for how the beam object used in the demo was constructed. 

Download either of these tutorials and open in jupyter notebook in order to run.
